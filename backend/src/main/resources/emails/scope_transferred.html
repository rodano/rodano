		<p>Dear ${study.defaultLocalizedLongname} Investigators and monitors,</p>

		<p>
			Patient ${scope.codeAndShortname} has been transferred within the ${study.defaultLocalizedLongname}
			Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system on ${date} from Originating site: center ${oldParentScope.codeAndShortname} to
			Destination site: center ${newParentScope.codeAndShortname}.

			Medications) still ongoing at the time of transfer as well as to resolve existing queries that were not answered or
			new queries that may be generated on data entered by the previous site.
